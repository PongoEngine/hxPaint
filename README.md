# hxPaint

--------

hxPaint is a very very very limited Paint Program written in Haxe.

The goal of this project is to break up key features of a real world application for future tutorials and also to showcase custom tooling in the process.

# Demo
https://pongoengine.github.io/hxPaint

As of Feb. 5th 2018 this project is mainly demonstraiting the power of constraint based layouts using [Jasper](//github.com/PongoEngine/jasper).

Goals
- Simplify layout management
- Create export formats.
- Allow custom project dimensions.
- Allow Scrolling
- Include custom key binding.
- Import images(for tracing)
- Import images(to pixel art)

The goals are not sequential nor guaranteed. Instead the goals are a rough outline of the broad scope of hxPaint.
